<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>So first things first my name is Esther but you can call me Esty. Am 13 years of age and school in a private school 
of course. So the main idea of this website is to be able to share with my friends common life problems and yeah come
up with a solution for each one. i actually would have loved a blog but yeah no knowledge is a waste so am fine withh it
. Sooner or later i will come up with a blog and my dear friends here will be the first to know.
</p>

<p>At first i actually liked an all girls website or blog but it is fine no gender discrimination though so lets do it 
for everyone though boys are not really into things like that but its fine its for everyone so we will be
fine so that is all from me for now.
